# Note Taker App
  ![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)
  
  ## Description
  This project was creating using express.js. The app allows the user to make notes of To-Dos that persists on the page by utilising API's and databases. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My motivation for this app was to create something that the user could use to help visualize and accomplish tasks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I built this app to be used as a tool for the everyday busy-body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This app will solve the problem of forgetting a task or anything. The user can check back in and pick up right where they left off by reading their notes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While bulding this app I learned a lot about express and routing! I utilized seperate files for each specific code, which presented me with challanges when it came to linking all the files togehter.
